## License
See the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/Geek202/TomsServerUtils/blob/main/LICENSE)

## Contributing
Most of this mod is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) with only a few components written in Java. Please try to write any contributions in Kotlin, the only exception for this is if you are adding a new mixin, as Kotlin support is Not Very Goodâ„¢. Some other things to note:
- If adding to the config, ensure to add a value [in the defaults](https://github.com/Geek202/TomsServerUtils/blob/main/src/main/resources/serverutils_default.toml)
- If adding literal strings displayed to players, please make use of the [translations file](https://github.com/Geek202/TomsServerUtils/blob/main/src/main/resources/data/toms-server-utils/lang/en_us.json) to ensure that they can be translated if wanted.
- Try not to break anything :)
